I doubt that would look any nicer with higher order functions. Specially if you want to get the same efficiency: notice how here we test that gcd(a,b)==1 as soon as possible. In general efficient comprehensions involve pushing any filtering as early as possible, so with higher order functions you get an alternation of filter with map&#x2F;flatmap.<p>Here&#x27;s a (probably lame) attempt at a Python higher order version:<p><pre><code>    flatmap = lambda f, l: [x for t in l for x in f(t)]
    
    flatmap(lambda a: flatmap(lambda b: flatmap(lambda c: (lambda d: [(a,b,c)] if a**3+b**3+c**3==d**3 else [])(int((a**3+b**3+c**3)**(1.0&#x2F;3)+0.5)) if gcd(a,c)==1 and gcd(b,c)==1 else [], range(b+1, 30)) if gcd(a,b)==1 else [], range(a+1,30)), range(1,30))
    </code></pre>
Maybe it would look nicer with some filters thrown in instead of abusing flatmap of empty lists, but it would be longer since you definitely need a flatmap for a and b, and either a flatmap or map for c.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a cleaner version with higher order function." :time 1566479152 :type "comment" :score 0)) (https://hacker-news\.firebaseio\.com/v0/item/20770710\.json (:by "11235813213455" :id "20770710" :kids (20770810 20772066) :parent "20767564" :text "the a:b notation for JS is still in proposal phase <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-slice-notation&#x2F;pull&#x2F;32\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-slice-notation&#x2F;pull&#x2F;32</a>, but I&#x27;ll use it below to create ranges<p>I don&#x27;t understand your `+0.5`, I&#x27;ve written below the transcription for your description<p><pre><code>    [...1:30].map(a =&gt;

Any $10&#x2F;hour freelance game artist can tell him that the problem with the games is a mismatch in detail, between background and characters, between resolution and texture detail. This makes tiles look either blurry or covered in white noise and together with a sever lack of contrast, makes the game look flat and unlit.<p>Solving that doesn&#x27;t require hiring expensive artists, it first involves acknowledging there&#x27;s an issue at the core that can&#x27;t be solved by sticking stuff on top of it. I see zero patience or passion for that and that&#x27;s why their games look the same as 25 years ago (and I could argue, <i>worse</i>, since higher resolution doesn&#x27;t do them any favors).<p>Again, I have no problem with their games and them looking like they do but going into defense here is a battle they can&#x27;t win.

If I lived there I doubt I&#x27;d criticize their system, especially considering people still can remember worse times.  For young Hong Kongers however, they didn&#x27;t live during British rule.  They were born into wealth, and now their own career prospects (like many millenials around the world) aren&#x27;t great.  So they protest.<p>The unfortunate thing is that they&#x27;ll fail.  The finance industry is already planning to exit HK (too volatile), and China can kill the rest of their economy.  Rich HKers will leave.  In the end, the protests will only hurt HK.<p>Occupy Wall Street didn&#x27;t do anything, successive Ukrainian revolutions never lasted either.  Ukraine is often cited: after the Orange Revolution, Yanukovych eventually came back to power.  Poroshenko had his time, but lost in the biggest landslide in Ukraine&#x27;s short history.  Now Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe, they&#x27;re not in the EU, they&#x27;re not in Nato, they lost Crimea, Donbass is at war, and while Zelensky can&#x27;t possibly be any worse, there&#x27;s no clear sign things will get better." :time 1566430670 :type "comment" :score 0)) (https://hacker-news\.firebaseio\.com/v0/item/20763773\.json (:by "11thEarlOfMar" :id "20763773" :kids (20763842 20763807) :parent "20763102" :text "I think the protesters will offer a different slant. From what I&#x27;ve read, they genuinely understand that what is at stake is their freedom to choose their own path. They&#x27;ve watched as China has gradually taken control of the governing body, the media, the financial management and the police. Each transpired more or less over a number of years, but each was also worrisome and that worry and anxiety pent up. The trigger for the current mass-action was not an economic event, it was a judicial one: A new law was proposed that would enable any court in China to charge and then extradite a Hong Kong resident without checks by Hong Kong&#x27;s judges. Effectively, it would mean that Hong Kong&#x27;s judicial system was subordinate to China&#x27;s judicial system, and therefore, did not have a judicial system at all.<p>There have been many foreboding events that portend the loss of liberty that Hong Kong residence fear. Liberty is what they are fighting to keep. Not wealth.<p>Addendum: The Chinese judicial system is as one with the communist party. It does not operate the same basic law that Western countries, and tenuously Hong Kong, operate. Under China&#x27;s judicial system, people literally disappear for months or more with no information provided to family or employer.
