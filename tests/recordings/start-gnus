I sometimes ask young programmers this: Do you care about the craft or the career? I think being a great programmer will make a person money. There aren&#x27;t that many truly great programmers. But if they&#x27;re impatient or they don&#x27;t think they can be great, they can probably be senior.<p>Becoming senior is easy: Just help your boss accomplish their goals. Pay attention and develop skills that will help you do this no matter where you are and what you&#x27;re working on. If you over-specialize in a specific organization or person&#x27;s need, you become the expert beginner and you can&#x27;t leave or you will struggle.<p>Some of the things that help a person be senior can also make them great. But the path to being great is a very different and personal one (at least that&#x27;s the impression I got from Coders At Work. I make no claims for myself.) Jeff Dean is undoubtedly a great programmer and was also the most senior developer at Google for a long time. They made new levels just for him. So they can overlap. If someone is lucky and their job is great, the things that make them senior can also make them great. If their job sucks and management is terrible, they&#x27;ll have to choose every day between doing something great or doing something to get promoted (being senior.)<p>My favorite article on the journey of a software engineer is this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@webseanhickey&#x2F;the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@webseanhickey&#x2F;the-evolution-of-a-softwar...</a> .

It&#x27;s a far cry from being able to understand content you find in the wild.<p>Also, &quot;understanding&quot; a Kanji is an ill-defined term. Most Kanji have multiple meanings based on context, and many different readings. So for each Kanji you&#x27;re not learning a single character, but possibly a lot more. Especially the Kanji that correspond to more abstract concepts you cannot learn by themselves. They don&#x27;t have a concrete meaning like &quot;eat&quot; or &quot;drink&quot;. You essentially have to memorize all of their word compounds, a single character does not help.<p>EDIT: I also started out learning Japanese by memorizing the top 2000 Kanji using Spaced Repetition. While it definitely helped, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as useful as some of these marketing-driven sites want you to believe. Kanji meaning are too complex to be captured like that. Even if you &quot;know&quot; all Kanji in a word you&#x27;ll likely not understand the word&#x27;s meaning unless it&#x27;s something simple and concrete. I think you are much better of memorizing and studying word compounds. Over time you will automatically &quot;pattern match&quot; the Kanji you see often to their abstract concepts.<p>Example from 1min of browsing a JP text: Take &quot;可能&quot; which is a very common word that usually means &quot;possible&quot;. Knowing the two Kanji (tolerant and ability) it not going to help you. It could mean dozens of other things based on those simplified Kanji meanings. This is not an exception, the majority of words are like this. On the other hand, let me give you a bunch of words containing &quot;可&quot;: 許可、可決、可能性、不可欠 (permission, approval, possibility, essential) and you start to pattern-match that &quot;可&quot; corresponds to something like &quot;positive possibility&quot;, but it&#x27;s hard to translate." :time 1566018216 :type "comment" :score 0)) ("20722388" (:by "WnZ39p0Dgydaz1" :id "20722388" :kids (20722539 20723103 20722467) :parent "20722193" :text "Afterthought: Kawaii (cute) is actually 可愛い, also containing &quot;可&quot;, which literally may mean something like &quot;a thing that can be easily loved&quot;, or simpler, cute.

We&#x27;re building a breathalyzer for cannabis.<p>I bet some of you have had the same idea cross your mind that we had: &quot;If we have a breathalyzer for alcohol, why don&#x27;t we have a breathalyzer for cannabis?&quot; We&#x27;re nanotechnology engineering alumni from the University of Waterloo. Two factors led into us deciding to pursue this idea: 1. Cannabis was being legalized across Canada and police were completely ill-prepared, so we saw an opportunity to help; 2. the science required to make this device exist was particularly interesting.<p>Alcohol breathalyzers are fundamentally a fuel cell where the alcohol in your breath sample is oxidized, which then produces an electrical current that the device then translates to BAC. For alcohol, this works because of Henry&#x27;s Law, which says that at any given temperature the ratio between the concentration of alcohol in the blood and that in the alveolar air in the lungs is constant.<p>Cannabis is a very different beast. Not only is it a non-volatile, fat-soluble molecule, but the mechanism in which THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis) appears in your breath isn&#x27;t super straight forward. Also, it is present in much lower concentrations in the breath compared to alcohol. Whereas a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% (the legal limit in most states) might result in a concentration of 208 ppm of ethanol in the breath, a similarly impairing dose of cannabis results in 0.00001 ppm of the drug in breath.<p>Detecting such a low concentration is difficult, and as a result, cannabis drug use has been detected in a variety of sub-optimal ways. The state of the art is a blood draw, followed by detection of THC at a toxicology laboratory using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. While accurate and well-validated, this approach has several problems. First of all, since THC is fat-soluble it remains in a person&#x27;s body much longer than alcohol, especially if that person is a frequent user. Frequent users have been known to have detectable THC in their blood one week after beginning abstinence. These people are clearly not impaired all week but could be arrested and charged with a DUI based on many states laws across the US. Interestingly, police have the opposite problem with infrequent users. For most people, the concentration of THC in their system will decay quickly post-consumption. It takes around 2 hours (at best) for a police officer to get a blood draw from a suspect. At this point, many people will no longer have detectable THC in their system. Our device solves both these problems for police. Our breathalyzer uses an ultra-sensitive immunosensor to detect the minute concentration of THC in breath. Breath is the better medium for cannabis testing for several reasons. First of all, THC concentration in breath for both frequent users and infrequent users decays below detectable levels within 3-4 hours post-consumption and we have never detected THC in the baseline for any of our subjects. So our device does not incorrectly identify frequent users as impaired as blood testing can. Secondly, the breath tests can be administered quickly roadside, eliminating the risk of concentration decay seen with blood draws.<p>Our device comes with a reusable analyzer and a single-use disposable cartridge. It costs us $2 to make a cartridge, and police are willing to pay $20 per test. An individual will breathe into the mouthpiece, and our filter system will collect exhaled breath particles (specifically non-VOCs). Currently, we manually &quot;extract&quot; the THC off of the filter into a solvent liquid, but in the future, this will be automated using novel microfluidics. The solvent, with the captured THC, is then transferred to the surface of the sensor- which is an electrochemical immunoassay. When the THC is there, the output signal is different than when the THC is not there (happy to dive further into this in the comments if people are interested).<p>We haven&#x27;t had enough resources to run any formal trials yet to publish data, but that is changing this year. We&#x27;ve hired a contract research organization, (shout out Curebase), to help us run our very first clinical trial with blood draws. We&#x27;re going to be looking at the correlation between breath and blood concentrations, at various time intervals after consumption, to validate (or invalidate!) our preliminary in house data.<p>Selling to the police is notoriously difficult, but we&#x27;re imagining a world where there are one of our devices in every police car in North America. This weekend we exhibited at the IACP DAID and the response from the attendees was great! We have over 30 police departments across North America that have expressed interest in purchasing the device and that number is increasing every day.<p>We&#x27;re excited to hear all your questions and feedback!
